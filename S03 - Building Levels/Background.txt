You can create the same effect in Godot version 4.3 using a Parallax2D Node.
Add a Node2D as a child of the Camera, save it as its own scene, then open it.
Add a Parallax2D node for each background layer.
Then populate each layer with Sprites and Animated Sprites to draw each background layer.
When using pixel art, remember to set the texture filter to Nearest.
For images that are supposed to wrap, set the repeat size to the size of the image.
Other individual images like clouds that you want to repeat can use any number larger than their size depending on how often you want them to repeat.
Set repeat to 2 so there is a copy both before and after.
Give each layer different auto scroll speeds, with layers farthest away scrolling slower, and closer layers scrolling faster.
You may not want layer 0 to scroll at all.
Turn on Ignore Camera Scroll for each layer.
Make sure that all images are repeated enough times to cover a screen width on both sides to prevent sudden disappearances.
Some images may need to be shifted off-center.
Return to the main scene and set the Ordering Z-Index to -1.
Now the background will scroll automatically, giving the illusion of an infinite horizon.
